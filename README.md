# SJQ
#### The Simple jQuery-like API

SJQ is a new, tiny jQuery-like API that runs similarly to jQuery, but only with the core bits of it.
It comes with a few 'base' functions that can be run on the main `$()` function. These include the extremely useful `$().html()`, `$().text()`, `$().each()` and so on.

The main function runs similarly to jQuery's, in the way that it uses `document.querySelectorAll()` to do good & easy CSS selection of HTML elements. It also features use of `$(HTMLElement)` and `$(SJQObject)`.

The code is hosted at http://code.zoweb.me/sjq/sjq-1.1.0.js.



I've made a few things for you to use, but the rest *is up to you!* See [the wiki](http://learninternet.zoweb.me/learn/js_sjq "The Wiki")
